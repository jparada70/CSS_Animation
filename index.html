Stick butt in face intently sniff hand, so give me attention or face the wrath of my claws, mrow hide from vacuum cleaner, chase after silly colored fish toys around the house demand to have some of whatever the human is cooking, then sniff the offering and walk away. Cat snacks rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent run in circles pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it! pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms. Lick butt and make a weird face behind the couch, but peer out window, chatter at birds, lure them to mouth fall asleep on the washing machine, lick yarn hanging out of own butt. Dont wait for the storm to pass, dance in the rain. Hide when guests come over. Scratch leg; meow for can opener to feed me.
